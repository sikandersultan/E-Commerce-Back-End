## Description 

As a manager of an absolute massive hypermarket chain and a part-time backend developer, I would sure love a backend application to keep track of all my inventory which ranges from Vynil records, to Branded baseball hats. Why so much variety? Even I am not sure but hey it's there at least. So this program is absolutely perfect for me!

## Usage

The application can be started in the commandline application of your choice. I used GitBash and it is very good. Additionally, you will also need MySql installed to start and run the database, as well as Insomnia or a similar program to interact with the database. To start the application, first install all the dependecies using `npm i`, then create the database by going into the db/ folder and using mysql to source the schema.sql file. Go back to the main folder and run the command `node seeds/index.js` to seed the database. Then run the command `npm start` to begin the app. In case of any confusion, a link to a video guide is avaliable just below. Thanks!
